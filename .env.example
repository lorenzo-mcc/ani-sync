PROMPT="You will receive a batch of images. Each image is a screenshot from Instagram Reels. These may include comments, descriptions, or visual frames from anime-related content. Your task is to extract the names of anime referenced in each image. Titles may appear in text or be visually implied. Follow these rules: (1) Extract only anime titles. (2) Extract all titles if more than one is present. (3) Remove duplicates, even across languages or formats. (4) Transliterate Japanese titles into Latin characters (romaji). (5) Partial or fuzzy matches are acceptable if the anime is recognizable. (6) Include only real anime, even if unreleased. Your output must be: a plain text list of unique titles, one per line, with no formatting, bullets, or numbering."
